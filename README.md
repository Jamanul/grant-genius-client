Project overview: My website gives easy access to a diverse range of university scholarships, offering a easy application process with integrated payment options for users. Then, users can provide and manage reviews for scholarships, while adminis and moderators have a dashboard to manage listings, applications, reviews, and user roles efficiently.

The 3 main feature of my website :
- My website offers a scholarship management system where users can explore various scholarships, apply directly through the site and make secure payments. Users have full control over their applications and reviews, allowing them to edit or delete their submissions as needed.
- Another key feature is the user review system, where users can provide valuable feedback on scholarships and update or remove their reviews to keep information accurate and helpful for other users.
- For admins and moderators, the site provides a dashboard to manage scholarship listings, including adding, editing, and deleting entries. They can also handle user applications and reviews, canceling applications or removing reviews if necessary, and admins have the ability to assign different roles to users.
